*Linux brigdes - way to connect two Ethernet segments together in a protocol independent way. Based on Ethernet address rather 					than IP address (like a router) (LAYER 2)

*IPTables - used to set up, maintain and inspect the tables of IPv4 and IPv6 (ip6tables) packet filter rules in the Linux Kernel.
			The tables are: filter, nat, mangle, raw, security.
			These tables are provided by the Linux kernel FIREWALL

*Gateway - Cloud storage gateway - is a network applicance or server which translates cloud storage APIs such as SOAP or REST to block-base storage protocols such as NFS or CIFS.
		   Cloud Storage Gateways enable companies to integrate cloud storage into applications without moving the applications into the cloud.

DNS - Domain Name System - is a hierarchical distributed naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network.
		translates Internet domain and host names to IP Addresses. DNS automatically converts the names we type to the IP addressed of web servers hosting. NS implements a distributed database to store this name and address information for all public hosts on the Internet. DNS assumes IP addresses do not change (are statically assigned rather than dynamically assigned).
